Quick install docs for those comfortable with things like svn, installing C
libraries from source and CPAN.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check out the SOBAcl code from SVN

svn co svn://malachite.genetics.utah.edu/SOBAcl/trunk SOBAcl

Put the SOBAcl file in your path (either by moving it to something
already in your path (like /usr/local/bin. ~/bin), softlinking it to
somewhere in your path instead of moving it, or adding it's location
to your path).

Non-perl prerequisites:
libgd # The GD library http://www.libgd.org/Main_Page
    libgd optionally requires (but you really want most of them).
    1. zlib, available from http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
       Data compression library

    2. libpng, available from http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/
       Portable Network Graphics library; requires zlib

    3. FreeType 2.x, available from http://www.freetype.org/
       Free, high-quality, and portable font engine

    4. JPEG library, available from http://www.ijg.org/
       Portable JPEG compression/decompression library

    5. XPM, available from http://koala.ilog.fr/lehors/xpm.html
       X Pixmap library
       This library is optional and is only used to import XPM
       graphics files.  Unless you know you need it, don't worry
       about it.

    Installing libgd can be easy or a nightmare depending on your
    platform.  Things like yum, apt and fink are your freinds, but you
    may have to resort to installing some or all of the above from
    source.  I've had the go very well, and very badly depending on
    the system.

Graphviz: Graphviz is open source graph visualization software.  Here
we are talking about graphs as diagrams of abstract graphs and
networks not line graphs and pie charts like we were above.  The well
supporte graphviz library provides binaries, installers, and source
code for installation.  See their website for details.
